* Lecturer, Programming for Physicists, Autumn 2023. Stockholm Univ.
* Lecturer, Scientific Computing III (PDEs: FDM and FEM, Linear systems: iterative methods), Winter 2021. Uppsala Univ.
* Lecturer, Programming in Python, Autumn 2020. Uppsala Univ.
* Lecturer, Scientific Computing bridging course (Linear systems, ODEs), Autumn 2020. Uppsala Univ.
* Teaching assistant, Scientific Computing II (ODEs), Spring 2019. Uppsala Univ.
* Teaching assistant, Scientific Computing II, Winter 2018. Uppsala Univ.
* Teaching assistant, Computer lab, 2012-2014. University of Ljubljana, Dept. Mathematics and Physics.
