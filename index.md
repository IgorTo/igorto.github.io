Since August 2025 I am tenured Research Associate (Docent) at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Before that I was a postdoc at Stockholm University (Computational Mathematics) and a Ph.D. candidate at Uppsala University (Scientific Computing) in Sweden. I completed master studies at Technical University Munich (Computational Science) in Germany.

My research focuses on numerical methods for partial differential equations. 
By bridging numerical and functional analysis, I aim to improve the reliability of computational methods such as:
- finite elements, 
- kernel-based methods, 
- and neural networks.

My mathematical work is motivated by advanced multiphysics problems that carry significant societal relevance in:

- climate, 
- biomedical, 
- and energy applications.
