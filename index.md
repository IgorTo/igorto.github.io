Since August 2025 I am tenured Research Associate (Docent) at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Before that I was a postdoc at Stockholm University (Computational Mathematics) a Ph.D. candidate at Uppsala University (Scientific Computing) in Sweden, and a master student at Technical University Munich in Germany.

My research focuses on numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). I aim to improve the reliability of computational methods such as:
- finite elements, 
- kernel-based methods, 
- and neural networks, 

by bridging numerical and functional analysis. My mathematical work is motivated by advanced multiphysics problems that carry significant societal relevance in:

- climate, 
- biomedical, 
- and energy applications.


### Current research interests:
- Time-step size estimation for multiphysics problems.
- Well-posedness of mixed PDE problems.
- Dimensionality gaps in interior data-informed PDE settings.
