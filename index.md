I am a tenured Research Associate (Docent) at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana.

My work focuses on developing and analyzing numerical algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in advanced multiphysics problems that carry significant societal relevance, such as in climate, biomedical, and energy applications.

I aim to improve the robustness and reliability of various computational methods by bridging numerical and functional analysis.

### Current research interests:
- Stability of coupled and multiphysics PDE models.
- Maximum time-step size estimation.
- Well-posedness of mixed PDE problems.
